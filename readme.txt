Minimalistic BuddyPress Theme Using Twitter Bootstrap

== Description ==

BuddyStrap is not a kinky sex toy. It's a theme for BuddyPress built with Twitter Bootstrap (currently at 2.2.1). This is a side project (literally done on a weekend) that was created at request for those wanting this sort of thing. It is supposed to mimic the default BuddyPress 1.6 theme, and is supposed to modify the theme and things as little as possible. 

This theme is recommended for BuddyPress developers with some measure of experience. Due to the state of the code, I wouldn't recommend this for a development environment. This is primarily to show you what's possible.

Current "cool factors":

* Once logged in, user dropdown menu in header provides more effective use of space IMO.
* In the profile edit screen, the edit menu is a dropdown thus removing the "third menu" (which usually includes the base profile category and whatever else you throw in).

This theme is in active development, although as a side project might collect some dust. For feature requests and bug reports, visit http://github.com/dimensionmedia/buddystrap. I offer no guarantee for support requests, questions, etc. You are pretty much on your own. But if you do want to offer a shout of praise, ping me on Twitter at @dimensionmedia.
